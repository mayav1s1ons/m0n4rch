This composition is part of a series created in the live code-able video synth, Hydra (https://hydra.ojack.xyz/?sketch_id=ritchse_4). 

> Created by Olivia Jack, Hydra is written in Javascript and systemitized by WebGL. The syntax created was inspired by analog modular synthesis in which chaining sets of transformations together generates a visual.
